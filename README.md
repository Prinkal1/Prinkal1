# Hi, I'm Prinkal ðŸ‘‹

>  ðŸ’» Full-Stack Software Engineer 


---

I am fresher looking for the role as a software engineer.
My passion lies in solving challenging problems, designing systems, and communicating complex ideas to non-technical stakeholders.
I always look forward to exceeding expectations and I am effective both working as an individual and as part of a team.

In my spare time, I like to read :books:, listen to music :headphones: and watch movies :tv:.

I enjoy trying out emerging technologies and connecting with people across a wide range of backgrounds. 
If you ever want to bounce ideas off of me or even just have a chat about my favorite anime, please feel free to reach out. ðŸ˜„
